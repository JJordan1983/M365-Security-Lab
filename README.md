# Microsoft 365 Security Labs 🚀

This repository contains hands-on labs showcasing my skills in **Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance**. Each lab is designed to demonstrate practical expertise in the exact tools and responsibilities outlined for an **Associate Microsoft 365 Security Engineer** role.

## 🎯 Objective
To provide clear, step-by-step demonstrations of configuring, monitoring, and securing Microsoft 365 environments — with an emphasis on **Defender, Entra ID, Intune, Purview, and Sentinel**.  
These labs highlight my ability to implement, test, and document security controls in an asynchronous and results-driven way.
